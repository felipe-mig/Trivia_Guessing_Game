# Trivia_Guessing_Game
In this project, I built a Trivia Guessing Game using an API for the questions and Python. The user will respond with True or False to the questions. Additionally, they will add 1 point to their score each time the answer is correct.

To start the game, please run the main.py file on your terminal. Enjoy!
